#about
Lucky you stumbled upon my profile! Born in 2004, I've been immersed in
computer networking knowledge since childhood. I'm currently a freelance
laissez-faire designer, a developer you shouldn't trust, an architect with a
tech stack messier than a first LEGO set, a product designer whose designs
have gone unnoticed, an operations guy with triple-digit views, and a
blockchain developer who's experienced a few too many "Oops!" moments.

Though I often wear the hat of a Security Researcher, my days aren't filled
with the monotony of NetworkStreams. Instead, I craft applications and
protocols in the vast and intriguing realm of cybersecurity. So, let's ditch
the "Vulnerability = ALL" mindset, shall we?

Over the past decade, I've worn many hats—product design, security research,
front-end, back-end, software dev, blockchain, DevOps—you name it.

Nowadays, I lead the Jiangxue Academy Union Lab Team, dedicated to Fringe
Science Research and Support. Fringe Science Research and Support.

\*I'm well aware that my understanding of design, development, and security is not yet sufficient.

Therefore, all experiences before 2024 are flawed to some extent, and I plan to address these shortcomings as I continue to learn and grow.

failure is not fatal: It is the courage to continue that counts.<br>
失败无可厚非；重要的是拾起继续前行的勇气。
